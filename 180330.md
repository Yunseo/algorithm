## Problems 
Among 12 additional problems in "VI big-O" chapter, only several selected problems are written.

### VI. 8
- Difference btw Binary Tree(BT) and Binary Search Tree(BST)
  - Binary tree is a tree whose nodes have at most 2 children.
  - Binary search tree is a binary tree satisfies following:
    - for each nodes, left child's value <=(or <) node's value < (or <=) right child's value, if it has children. 

### VI. 11
- for making all the words with length k => O(26 ^ k) // 26 is the number of alphabets.
- after making all the words, for comparing its order => O(k)
- Thus, O(k*26^k)

## English expressions
- a*b = product of `a` and `b`
- a^b = `a` to the `b`-th power
- a/b = `a` over `b`
